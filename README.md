# Hi, I’m Daniel 👋

🚀 **Aerospace Engineering @ UCLA** (B.S. 2026 → M.S. 2027)  
🎯 Focus: **Controls, Guidance, Navigation & Control (GNC), Attitude Determination & Control (ADCS)**  

---

## 🔧 Current Projects
- **Attitude Control Simulator (Python)**  
  - 6-DoF rigid-body sim with quaternions, PD/PID controllers, and command shaping.  
  - Custom trajectory generation (slew maneuvers, trapezoidal/angular rate shaping).  
  - Modular architecture (`state`, `quaternion`, `controllers`, `spacecraft`) built for extensibility.  
  - Visualization tools for time histories & quaternion dynamics.

- **Crazyflie 2.1 on 3-Axis Passive Gimbal** (UCLA Mechatronics & Controls Lab)  
  - Integrating MATLAB/Simscape with SolidWorks CAD for dynamics.  
  - Developing attitude determination algorithms from IMU/star sensor data.  
  - Designing control experiments for drone-on-gimbal systems.

## 📚 Coursework & Skills
- **Core:** MAE 107 (Intro to Control), 171A/B (Flight Controls), 172 (Aerospace Design), etc.  
- **Programming:** Python, MATLAB/Simulink, C++, Bash, Git
- **Modeling/Simulation:** Nonlinear dynamics, rigid body kinematics, Simscape Multibody integration.  
- **Design Tools:** SolidWorks, CAD → Simscape pipelines.  

---

## 🌱 Goals
- Secure an **industry internship (Summer 2026)** in spacecraft GNC/ACS.  
- Build out a **portfolio of flight dynamics & control projects** (both sim and hardware).  
- Grow into a role where I can work on **spacecraft ADCS/GNC systems** in the commercial space sector.
